This plugin provides a protocol analyzer for the OSI Association Control
Service (ACSE) (ISO 8650 /i X.227) for use within Zeek. The analyzer enables
Zeek to parse ACSE pdus and forwards pdus of lower layers (e.g. MMS) to the
corresponding analyzer according to the information provided by the
Presentation layer (SESS Analyzer)
